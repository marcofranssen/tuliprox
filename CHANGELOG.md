# Changelog

## Unreleased

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Global Input Definitions**: To align input definitions with the SourceEditor, inputs are now defined globally in the `inputs` section of the
  config file. Each source can reference one or more inputs by their name in the `inputs` attribute.
- **Data Format Migration**: Due to heavy refactoring, the old data format is invalid. You need to clean your `data` folder and update the playlists.
- **B+Tree Storage Format**: Storage format has changed to a more efficient Slotted Page architecture.
  - **Index optimization**: Added index to B+Tree to accelerate queries without tree traversal.
  - **TargetIdMapping Optimization**: Refactored to use disk-based B+Tree operations, eliminating startup latency.
  - **B+Tree Header Metadata**: Implemented efficient `BPlusTreeMetadata` Enum to persist `VirtualId` counter directly in the database header.
  - **Fast Initialization**: `TargetIdMapping` now conditionally loads the tree, achieving near-instant startup for established databases.
- **Configuration Renames**:
  - `threads` attribute in `config.yml` renamed to `process_parallel` (boolean).
  - Added mandatory `rewrite_secret` to `reverse_proxy` config for stable resource URLs.
  - Removed `forced_retry_interval_secs`.
- **Input Batch Changes**: `name` attribute is now mandatory for input type batch to ensure stable playlist UUIDs.
- **Favorites Redesign**: Replaced implicit `create_alias` with explicit `add_favourite(group_name)` script function.
  - **EpgSmartMatch**: Field `name_prefix` syntax needs to be changed from  `name_prefix: !suffix "."` to `name_prefix: { suffix: "." }`.
  - **Sort**: Sort can now use filter to sort specific entries.

    ```yaml
      sort:
        match_as_ascii: true
        rules:
          - target: group
            field: group
            filter: Input ~ "provider_1"
            order: asc
          - target: channel
            field: caption
            filter: Group ~ "!US_TNT_ENTERTAIN!"
            order: asc
            sequence:
              - "!CHAN_SEQ!"
              - '(?i)\bHD\b'
              - '(?i)\bSD\b'
      ```

  - Trakt api config field `key` is now `api_key`. Added `user_agent` field to Trakt api config
  - resolve_vod_delay and resolve_series_delay are now merged as resolve_delay, added `probe_live` and `probe_live_interval_hours` for live stream
    probing.

      ```yaml

       # Before (deprecated)
       output:
       - type: xtream
         resolve_vod: true
         resolve_vod_delay: 500
         resolve_series: true
         resolve_series_delay: 2
      ```

      ```yaml

       # After (new consolidated)
       output:
       - type: xtream
         resolve_vod: true
         resolve_series: true
         resolve_delay: 2  # Single delay for all resolution types
       ```

## 🌟 New Features

- **Smart Connection Priority**: Introduced a priority system for connections. Users with higher priority can preempt (kick) lower priority
  connections (e.g., background tasks or standard users) when provider slots are full.
- **Background Metadata Queue**: Metadata resolution (VOD/Series) and stream analysis are now queued per input and processed in the background when
  provider connections are idle. This prevents "No Connections" errors for active users during playlist updates.
- **Live TV Probing**: Added support for probing Live TV streams (`probe_live`) to determine codecs and resolution. This runs as a low-priority
  background task.
- **Discord Notifications**: Support for Discord notifications via webhooks with optional Handlebars templates.
- **Enhanced REST Messaging**: Support for custom HTTP methods, headers, and Handlebars templating.
- **Local Library Module**: Comprehensive local video file scanning and metadata management.
  - Recursive scanning, automatic classification, and NFO/TMDB metadata resolution.
  - Incremental scanning and virtual ID management.
- **Panel API Integration**: Optional integration to renew expired input accounts or provision new accounts to ensure a minimum valid input accounts.
- **Playlist Caching**: Added `cache_duration` to inputs, allowing configurable provider playlist cache times during subsequent updates (e.g., `60s`,
  `5m` `12h`, `1d`).
- **Database Viewer**: New CLI flags `--dbx` and `--dbm` to inspect internal database content.
- **Added `disk_based_processing`**: (boolean, default `false`) to `config.yml`. When enabled, input playlists are processed from disk instead of
  memory.
- **User-Agent `default_user_agent`**: Ensures that outgoing requests always pass a default user agent.
- **FFprobe Integration**: Added capability to probe streams for codec, resolution, HDR (HDR10/HLG/DV), and audio channels using `ffprobe`. Probing
  strictly respects provider connection limits. If no slot is available (considering user limits), the item is skipped to prevent provider bans.
- **Metadata Fallback**: Automatically fetches missing TMDB IDs and release dates via the TMDB API if the provider data is incomplete.
- **Streaming**: Added `grace_period_hold_stream` configuration option to delay stream output until grace period connection checks are completed.
- **Provider Failover & Rotation**: Tuliprox supports robust failover mechanisms for streaming providers.
  You can use the special `provider://<provider_name>/...` URL scheme in your configurations. Tuliprox will automatically resolve this to the current
active URL of the specified provider.
  If the current URL fails (e.g., 5xx error, timeout), Tuliprox automatically rotates to the next available URL for that provider.
  It tracks failures and prevents infinite loops by limiting attempts to the number of available URLs.
- Added `epg_request_timeshift: [-+]hh:mm or TimeZone`, example `Europe/Paris`, `America/New_York`, `-2:30`(-2h30m), `+0:15` (15m), `2` (2h), `:30`
  (30m), `:3` (3m)

## ⚙️ New Settings

- **config.yml**:
  - Added `video.ffprobe_enabled` (default: false) and `video.ffprobe_timeout`.
- **source.yml (input options)**:
  - Added `resolve_tmdb`: Triggers TMDB lookup if ID is missing.
  - Added `probe_stream`: Triggers ffprobe if technical info is missing.
- **source.yml (target output)**:
  - Added `probe_live`: Enables background probing for Live TV streams (default disabled).
  - Added `probe_live_interval_hours`: Sets the frequency for re-probing Live TV streams.
  - Added `resolve_background`: Toggles background metadata resolution (default `true`). Set to `false` for blocking, immediate resolution.

## 🛠 Optimizations

- **Quality Tagging**: Generates enhanced filename tags (e.g., `[2160p 4K HEVC HDR TrueHD 7.1]`) for STRM files based on analysis results.
- **Flat Grouping**: When `flat: true` option for STRM output is active, multiple versions (e.g., 4K and 1080p) of the same movie are now safely
  merged over all categories into a single folder based on TMDB ID, compatible with Jellyfin/Emby "Multi-Version" features.

## ⚙️ Engine & Storage Optimizations

- **Slotted Page Architecture**: Improved space utilization and support for variable-length keys.
- **Adaptive LZ4 Compression**: Optimized disk footprint for stored values.
- **Atomic I/O Layer**: Refactored for atomic writes and file locking, ensuring data integrity.
- **B+Tree Compaction**: Reclaim space after deletions or mass updates.
- **Batch Upsert**: Significantly higher throughput during mass inserts/updates.
- **Persistent Value Caching**: Implemented high-performance, thread-safe value caching
- **Compressed Read Optimization**: Caches decompressed values in memory to eliminate redundant decompression overhead during frequent queries.
- **Packed Block Update Optimization**: Caches exact byte offsets within 4KB blocks, enabling direct disk writes for same-size updates and bypassing
  expensive Read-Scan-Modify-Write cycles.
- **Buffer Reuse**: Introduced reusable serialization buffers in `BPlusTreeUpdate` to minimize heap allocations during write operations.
- **Configurable Flush Policy**: Added `Immediate`, `Batch`, and `None` flush policies to optimize disk synchronization overhead.
- **Disk-Based Provider Processing**: New `disk_based_processing` config option massively reduces RAM usage by streaming playlist data from disk
  (BPlusTree) during updates.
- **String Interning**: Implemented `Arc<str>` string interning for playlist items to further reduce memory footprint.
- **Zero-Copy B+Tree Scan**: Implemented zero-copy scanning for B+Tree internal nodes, significantly reducing heap allocations and improving random
  read throughput (up to 96k ops/sec).
- **Optimized Key Lookups**: `XtreamRepository` and `M3uRepository` now use zero-copy queries for `u32` keys, enhancing performance for high-traffic
  endpoints.

## 🔍 Mapping & Filtering Enhancements

- **Accent-Independent Matching**: Integrated `match_as_ascii` flag for robust text matching (e.g., "Cinema" matches "Cinéma").
- **Deunicoding Support**: `ValueProvider` and `ValueAccessor` now support on-the-fly deunicoding.
- **Flexible Sorting**: Added `order: none` support to retain source order in mappings.
- **Mapper Loop enhancement**: Updated `for_each` syntax to `variable.for_each((key, value) => { ... })`. Added support for `_` ignored variables in
  loop.

- Source editor: block selection, batch-mode UI and automatic layout
- Fixed SSL certificate field binding in configuration view
- More robust connection-state and provider-handle management
- Streamlined event notifications and provider-count reporting
- Added configurable `reverse_proxy.resource_retry` (UI + server) to tune max attempts, base delay, and exponential backoff multiplier for proxied
  resources.
- Multi Strm outputs with same type is now allowed.

- Fixed: Mappings now automatically reload and reapply after configuration changes, preventing stale settings.
- Search in Playlist Explorer now returns groups instead of matching flat channel list.
- Added `use_memory_cache` attribute to target definition to hold playlist in memory to reduce disc access.
  Placing playlist into memory causes more RAM usage but reduces disk access.
- Added optional `filter` attribute to Output (except HDHomerun-Output).
  Output filters are applied after all transformations have been performed, therefore, all filter contents must refer to the final state of the
playlist.

- Added burst buffer to shared stream
- Telegram message thread support. thread id can now be appended to chat-id like `chat-id:thread-id`.
- Telegram supports markdown generation for structured json messages. simply set `markdown: true` in telegram config.
- Added User-Stream-Connections Table to WebUI
- Enhanced STRM output filenames to include detailed media quality info (e.g., 4K, HDR, x265, 5.1) for easy version distinction.
- Added standardized SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) and the Proprietary HDHomeRun UDP Discovery Protocol (Port 65001)
- Fixed some session handling issue
- added `reverse_proxy.disabled_header` configuration
  Allows removing selected headers before forwarding requests when acting as a reverse proxy. Configure removal of the referer header, all `X-*`
headers, and additional custom headers.

- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `disble_referer_header` is now part of `reverse_proxy.disabled_header` configuration
- UserTable: Copy credentials to clipboard from user table
- UserTable: Kick user action from streams table
- UserTable: Auto-generated username/password for new proxy users
- Update process uses now streams for data processing.

## 3.1.7 (2025-10-10)

- Added Dark/Bright theme switch
- Resource proxy retries failed requests up to three times and respects the `Retry-After` header (falls back to 100 ms wait)
  to reduce transient HTTP errors (400, 408, 425, 429, 5xx)
- Added `accept_insecure_ssl_certificates` option in `config.yml` (for serving images over HTTPS without a valid SSL certificate)

- Fixed file length issue in STRM generation
- Fixed empty parentheses issue in series names
- Removed default sorting
- WebSocket now reconnects on disconnect; added WebSocket connection status icon in Web UI
- Added Playlist EPG view with timeline, channels, `now` line, and program details

  guides.
- Invalid EPG text data fix
- Added new sidebar entry and icon for quick EPG access
- Added CBOR (binary JSON) support for large API data

## 3.1.6 (2025-09-01)

## 3.1.4 (2025-06-17)

- share live stream refactored
- fixed active user count
- fixed hls streaming
- more logs sanitized
- added session key for session management
- added sleep timer  `sleep_timer_mins`  to config.yml
- added mapper script builtin function `template` to access template definitions.

```text

   station_prefix = template(concat("US_", station, "_PREFIX")),

```

If we assume the variable `station` contains the value `WINK`,
this script receives the template with the concatenated name `US_WINK_PREFIX` which should be defined in `templates` section,
and assigns it to the variable `station_prefix`.

- Extended STRM export functionality with:
  - Support for various media tools (Kodi, Plex, Emby, Jellyfin), with consideration for recommended naming conventions and file organization.
  - Optional flat directory structure via 'flat' parameter (nested folder structures are not supported by some media scanners).
- Added Trakt support for XC targets

```yaml
      - name: iptv-trakt-example
        output:
          - type: xtream
            skip_live_direct_source: true
            skip_video_direct_source: true
            skip_series_direct_source: true
            resolve_series: false
            resolve_vod: false
            trakt:
              api:
                key: <my private trakt api key>
                version: 2
              lists:
                - user: "linaspurinis"
                  list_slug: "top-watched-movies-of-the-week"
                  category_name: "📈 Top Weekly Movies"
                  content_type: "vod"
                  fuzzy_match_threshold: 80
                - user: "garycrawfordgc"
                  list_slug: "latest-tv-shows"
                  category_name: "📺 Latest TV Shows"
                  content_type: "series"
                  fuzzy_match_threshold: 80
```

## 3.1.3 (2025-06-06)

- Fixed xtream codes series info duplicate fields problem.
- Fixed series info container_extension problem.

  For example, you want to write a `if then else` block

```text

  # Maybe there is no station
  station = @Caption ~ "(ABC)"
  match {
     station => {
        # if block
        # station exists
     }
     # optional any match as else block
     _ => {
         # else block
         # station does not exists
     }
  }

```

- New BuiltIn Mapper function `first`. When you use Regular expressions it could be that your match contains multiple results.
  The builtin function `first` returns the first match.

## 3.1.2 (2025-06-02)

- fixed input filter
- fixed epg fuzzy match `match_threshold` default value
- fixed `auto` epg source

## 3.1.1 (2025-05-27)

- fixed m3u api hls handling
- during grace period no data is sent to client.
- splitted config file handling for accurate error messages

## 3.1.0 (2025-05-26)

- !BREAKING_CHANGE! mapper refactored, mapping can be written as a script with a custom DSL.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `tags` definition removed from new mapper.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! removed `suffix` and `prefix` from input config. Use mapper with an input filter instead.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! custom_stream_response is now `custom_stream_response_path`. The filename identifies the file inside the path
  - user_account_expired.ts
  - provider_connections_exhausted.ts
  - user_connections_exhausted.ts
  - channel_unavailable.ts
    `user_account_expired.ts`: Tuliprox will return a 403 Forbidden response for any playlist request if the user is expired.
    So this screen will only ever appear if someone tries to directly access a stream URL after their account has expired.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! epg refactored
  - url config is now renamed to sources
  - Added `priority`, priority is `optional`
  - `auto_epg` is now removed, use `url: auto` instead.
  - Added `logo_override` to overwrite logo from epg.

**Note:** The `priority` value determines the importance or order of processing. Lower numbers mean higher priority. That is:
A `priority` of `0` is higher than `1`. **Negative numbers** are allowed and represent even higher priority

```yaml
epg:
  sources:
    - url: "auto"
      priority: -2
      logo_override: true
    - url: "http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=1"
      priority: -1
    - url: "http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=2"
      priority: 3
    - url: "http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=3"
      priority: 0
  smart_match:
    enabled: true
    fuzzy_matching: true
    match_threshold: 80
    best_match_threshold: 99
    name_prefix: !suffix "."
    name_prefix_separator: [':', '|', '-']
    strip :  ["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]
    normalize_regex: '[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]'
```

- Fixed mapper transform capitalize.
- Auto hot reload for `mapping.yml`and `api_proxy.yml`
  To enable set `config_hot_reload: true` in `config.yml`
- Added config.d-style mapping support.
  You can now place multiple mapping files inside a directory like `mapping.d` and specify it using the `-m` option, for example:
  `-m /home/tuliprox/config/mapping.d`
  The files are loaded in **alphanumeric** order.
  **Note:** This is a lexicographic sort — so `m_10.yml` comes before `m_2.yml` unless you name files carefully (e.g., `m_01.yml`, `m_02.yml`, ...,
`m_10.yml`).

- Added `mapping_path` to `config.yml`.
- Added list template for sequences. List templates can only be used for sequences.

```yaml
templates:
  - name: CHAN_SEQ
    value:
      - '(?i)\bUHD\b'
      - '(?i)\bFHD\b'
```

The template can now be used for sequence

```yaml
  sort:
    groups:
      order: asc
    channels:
      - field: caption
        group_pattern: "!US_TNT_ENTERTAIN!"
        order: asc
        sequence:
          - "!CHAN_SEQ!"
          - '(?i)\bHD\b'
          - '(?i)\bSD\b'
```

- added `disable_referer_header` to `reverse_proxy` config
  This option, when set to `true`, prevents tuliprox from sending the Referer header in requests made when acting as a reverse proxy. This can be
particularly useful when dealing with certain Xtream Codes providers that might restrict or behave differently based on the Referer header. Default is
`false`.

```yaml

reverse_proxy:
  disable_referer_header: false
```

## 3.0.0 (2025-05-12)

- !BREAKING_CHANGE! user has now the attribute `ui_enabled` to disable/enable web_ui for user.
  You need to migrate the user db if you have used `use_user_db:true`.
  Set it to `false` run old tuliprox version, then update tuliprox and set `use_user_db:true`and start.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! all docker images have now tuliprox under `/app`
- !BREAKING CHANGE! bandwidth `throttle_kbps` attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`
  is now `throttle` and supports units. Allowed units are `KB/s`,`MB/s`,`KiB/s`,`MiB/s`,`kbps`,`mbps`,`Mibps`.
  Default unit is `kbps`.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE!  `log` config `active_clients` renamed to `log_active_user`
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `web_ui config` restructured and added `user_ui_enabled` attribute

```yaml

web_ui:
  enabled: true
  user_ui_enabled: true
  path:
  auth:
    enabled: true
    issuer: tuliprox
    secret: ef9ab256a8c0abe5de92c2e05ca92baa810472ab702ff1674e9248308ceeec92
    userfile: user.txt

```

- `grace_period_millis` default set to 300 milliseconds.
- `grace_period_timeout_secs` default set to 2 seconds.
- Fixed user grace period
- Added `default_grace_period_timeout_secs` to `reverse_proxy.stream` config. When grace_period granted,
  until the `default_grace_period_timeout_secs` elapses no grace_period is granted again.
- Added `method` attribute to input config. It can be set to `GET` or `POST`.
- Added optional `auto_epg` field to `input epg config` for auto-generating provider epg link.
- Added rate limiting per IP. The burst_size defines the initial number of available connections,
  while period_millis specifies the interval at which one connection is replenished.
  If behind a proxy `x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip` or `forwarded` should be set as header.
  The configuration below allows up to 10 connections initially and then replenishes 1 connection every 500 milliseconds.

```yaml

reverse_proxy:
  rate_limit:
    enabled: true
    period_millis: 500
    burst_size: 10

```

- Multi epg processing/optimization, auto guessing/assigning epg id's
- Fixed hls redirect url issue
- Added `force_redirect` to target config options. valid options are `live`, `vod`, `series`

```yaml

 options: {ignore_logo: false, share_live_streams: false, force_redirect: [vod, series]}

```

```yaml

epg:
  url: ['http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=1', 'http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=2']
  smart_match:
    enabled: true
    fuzzy_matching: true
    match_threshold: 80
    best_match_threshold: 99
    name_prefix: !suffix "."
    name_prefix_separator: [':', '|', '-']
    strip :  ["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]
    normalize_regex: '[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]'

```

`match_threshold`is optional and if not set 80.
`best_match_threshold` is optional and if not set 99.
`name_prefix` can be `ignore`, `suffix`, `prefix`. For `suffix` and `prefix` you need to define a concat string.
`strip :  ["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]`  this is the defualt
`normalize_regex: [^a-zA-Z0-9\-]`   is the default

```yaml

# single epg

url: 'https://localhost.com/epg.xml'

```

```yaml

# multi local file  epg

url: ['file:///${env:TULIPROX_HOME}/epg.xml', 'file:///${env:TULIPROX_HOME}/epg2.xml']

```

```yaml

# multi url  epg

url: ['http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=1', 'http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=2']

```

- Added `strip` to input for auto epg matching, if not given `["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]` is default
  When no matching epg_id is found, the display name is used to match a channel name. The given strings are stripped to get a better match.
- Fixed chno assignment issue
- Redirect Proxy provider cycle implemented (m3u playlist only cycles when output param `mask_redirect_url` is set).
- Reverse Proxy mode for user can now be a subset
  - `reverse`           -> all reverse
  - `reverse[live]`     -> only live reverse, vod and series redirect
  - `reverse[live,vod]` -> series redirect, others reverse
- `/status` api endpoint moved to  `/api/v1/status` for auth protection
- fixed multi provider VOD seek problem (provider cycle on seek request prevented playback)
- hdhomerun supports now basic auth like <http://user:password@ip:port/lineup.json>
  you need to enable auth in config

```yaml

hdhomerun:
  enabled: true
  auth: true
  devices:
    - name: hdhr1

```

- A new filter field `caption` has been added. This field is used to bypass the `title/name` issue.
  If `caption` is provided, its value is read from `title` if available, otherwise from `name`.
  When setting `caption`, both `title` and `name` are updated.”
- Counter has now an attribute `padding`. Which fills the number like 001.
- Added proxy configuration for all outgoing requests in `config.yml`. supported http, https, socks5 proxies.

```yaml

proxy:
  url: socks5://192.168.1.6:8123
  username: uname  # <- optional basic auth
  password: secret # <- optional basic auth

```

- Added support for regular expression-based sequence sorting.
  You can now sort both groups and channels using custom regex sequences.

```yaml
sort:
  groups:
  order: asc
  sequence:
    - '^Freetv'
    - '^Shopping'
    - '^Entertainment'
    - '^Sunrise'
  channels:
    - field: caption
      group_pattern: '^Freetv'
      order: asc
      sequence:
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bUHD\b'
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bFHD\b'
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bHD\b'
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bSD\b'
```

In the example above, groups are sorted based on the specified sequence.
Channels within the `Freetv` group are first sorted by `quality` (as matched by the regex sequence), and then by the `captured prefix`.

To sort by specific parts of the content, use named capture groups such as `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, etc.
The numeric suffix indicates the priority: `c1` is evaluated first, followed by `c2`, and so on.

- Added ip check config
  - url # URL that may return both IPv4 and IPv6 in one response
  - url_ipv4 # Dedicated URL to fetch only IPv4
  - url_ipv6 # Dedicated URL to fetch only IPv6
  - pattern_ipv4 # Optional regex pattern to extract IPv4
  - pattern_ipv6 # Optional regex pattern to extract IPv6

```yaml

ipcheck:
  url_ipv4: https://ipinfo.io/ip

```

## 2.2.5 (2025-03-27)

- fixed web ui playlist regexp search
- added `web_ui_path` to `config.yml`
- added grace period `grace_period_millis`  attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`
  If you have a provider or a user where the max_connection attribute is greater than 0,
  a grace period can be given during the switchover.
  If this period is set too short, it may result in access being denied in some cases.
  The default is 1000 milliseconds (1sec).
- added bandwidth `throttle_kbps` attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`

| Resolution      |Framerate| Bitrate (kbps) | Quality     |
|-----------------|---------|----------------|-------------|
|480p (854x480)   |  30 fps | 819–2.457      | Low-Quality |
|720p (1280x720)  |  30 fps | 2.457–5.737    | HD-Streams  |
|1080p (1920x1080)|  30 fps | 5.737–12.288   | Full-HD     |
|4K (3840x2160)   |  30 fps | 20.480–49.152  | Ultra-HD    |

## 2.2.4 (2025-03-24)

- fixed `connect_timeout_secs:0` prevents connection initiation issue.
- fixed `hdhomerun` and `strm` config check for non-existing username.
- "Breaking CHANGE! Moved `connect_timeout_secs` is global timeout and defiend in config root and not `reverse_proxy.stream`.

## 2.2.3 (2025-03-23)

- variable resolving for config files now for all settings
- hls reverse proxy implemented
- dash redirect implemented (reverse proxy not supported)
- !BREAKING CHANGE! `channel_unavailable_file` is now under `custom_stream_response`,
- New custom streams `user_connections_exhausted` and `provider_connections_exhausted`added.

```yaml

custom_stream_response:
  channel_unavailable: /home/tuliprox/resources/channel_unavailable.ts
  user_connections_exhausted: /home/tuliprox/resources/user_connections_exhausted.ts
  provider_connections_exhausted: /home/tuliprox/resources/provider_connections_exhausted.ts

```

- input alias definition for same provider with same content but different credentials

```yaml
- sources:
  - inputs:
    - type: xtream
      name: my_provider
      url: 'http://provider.net'
      username: xyz
      password: secret1
      aliases:
        - name: my_provider_2
          url: 'http://provider.net'
          username: abcd
          password: secret2
    targets:
      - name: test
```

Input aliases can be defined as batches in csv files with `;` separator.
There are 2 batch input types  `xtream_batch` and `m3u_batch`.
`XtreamBatch`:

```yaml
- sources:
  - inputs:
    - type: xtream_batch
      url: 'file:///home/tuliprox/config/my_provider_batch.csv'
    targets:
      - name: test
```

```csv

#name;username;password;url;max_connections;priority
my_provider_1;user1;password1;http://my_provider_1.com:80;1;0
my_provider_2;user2;password2;http://my_provider_2.com:8080;1;0

```

`M3uBatch`:

```yaml
- sources:
  - inputs:
    - type: m3u_batch
      url: 'file:///home/tuliprox/config/my_provider_batch.csv'
    targets:
    - name: test
```

```csv

#url;max_connections;priority
http://my_provider_1.com:80/get_php?username=user1&password=password1;1;0
http://my_provider_2.com:8080/get_php?username=user2&password=password2;1;0

```

The Fields `max_connections` and `priority`are optional.
`max_connections`  will be set default to `1`. This is different from yaml config where the default is `0=unlimited`

- added two options to reverse proxy config `forced_retry_interval_secs` and `connect_timeout_secs`
  `forced_retry_interval_secs` forces every x seconds a reconnect to the provider,
  `connect_timeout_secs` tries only x seconds for connection, if not successfully starts a retry.

## 2.2.2 (2025-03-12)

- !BREAKING CHANGE! Target options moved to specific target output definitions.

target `options`:

- `ignore_logo`: `true`|`false`,

- `device`: _mandatory_,
- `username`: _mandatory_,
- `use_output`: _optional_, `m3u`|`xtream`

Example:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: xc_m3u
    output:
      - type: xtream
        skip_live_direct_source: true,
        skip_video_direct_source: true,
      - type: m3u
      - type: strm
        directory: /tmp/kodi
      - type: hdhomerun
        username: hdhruser

- Added `user_config_dir` to `config.yml`. It is the storage path for user configurations (f.e. bouquets).
- New Filter field `input` can be used along `name`, `group`, `title`, `url` and `type`. Input is a `regexp` filter. `input ~ "provider\-\d+"`
- New option `use_user_db` in `api-proxy.yml`. The Playlist Users are stored inside the config file `api-proxy.yml`. When you set this option to
  `true`
  the user are stored in a db file. This is a better choice if you have a lot of users. If you have only a few let it default to `false`

  `strm` files now o get timestamp from `addedd`property if exists.
- shared live stream implementation refactored.
- added optional user properties: `max_connections`, `status`, `exp_date` (expiration date as unix seconds).
  If they exist they are checked when `config.yml` `user_access_control` set to true., if you don't need them remove this fields from `api-proxy.yml`
  Added option in `config.yml` the option `user_access_control` to activate the checks. Default is false.
- Added option `channel_unavailable_file` in `config.yml`. If a provider stream is not available this file content is send instead.
